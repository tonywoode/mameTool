  "efindBoringSystemsComment": "Many systems aren't of interest since they're never going to have enjoyable games. Don't make an efind for them, (its pretty clear they don't have softlists!). The only way to know is to google. It was easiest to specify the fully munged system types (that's why I remove these as a last step in the efind process). So the source of comparison is a finished efind, compared against a previous efind for newly-added boring systems. It's probably wise to deal with these BEFORE changing any company names in scan/datAndEfind/mungeCompanyAndSystemNames.js (which seems to get done as a previous step), since you'll be wasting time otherwise. This key is called by removeBoringSystems.js in the scan/datAndEfind folder",

  "embeddedSystemsBoringSystemsComment": "same as previous key but for embeedded so called from scan/embeddedSystems/removeBoringSystems. However its massive, this is becuase there were a great many computers over time that had embedded roms but no games. the way to filter these is to compare against a previous romdata for embedded systems",

Some games may exist though (that's why we remove them here but keep them as emulators). Don't process further. Don't make a softlist for them.
