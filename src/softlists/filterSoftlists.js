   *   So, try and get the device from the softlist name and check. Considerations:
   *     1) There's no point in looking in a softlist xml for devices it's about, unless you want to try and parse the free text 'name' field
   *     2) Some softlist names don't have a postfix, but we're assuming we don't 'need' the device name 
   *       (we can, we think, always call 'nes smb' and we never need to 'nes -cart smb'. TODO: This needs confirming)
   *     3) some postfixes are not about the device - we've got _a1000, _workbench, _hardware
